# Schema Markup Implementation Guide

## Overview
This repository provides a step-by-step guide for implementing manual schema markup on your website. Schema markup helps search engines understand the content and context of your web pages, leading to better visibility in search results.

## Why I created this repo?
I‚Äôm an SEO expert, and one day, I decided to explore Shopify. My mission? To manually adding schema markup. Now, I‚Äôm not a coding pro or a Shopify expert, but I wanted to learn. So, let me explain more in detail.

üîç The Problem: I needed to find information about implementing schema markup manually on Shopify. Most tutorials were outdated and  complicated‚Äîthey assumed everyone was a coding genius or talked about old stuff like ‚Äúproduct.liquid.‚Äù

üõ†Ô∏è My Solution: Started experimenting with something called ‚Äúliquid variables.‚Äù It sounds fancy, but it‚Äôs just a way to get info from Shopify. I figured out which variables to utilise for product details.

üìÇ Navigating Files: The usual ‚Äúproduct.liquid‚Äù file wasn‚Äôt around anymore. But after editing a bunch of liquid and json files, I stumbled upon ‚Äúmain-product.liquid‚Äù This was the secret sauce for adding schema markup manually.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with schema markup:

1. **Understanding Schema Markup:**
   - This repo is specificaly dedicated for Product schema markup implementation with rating and review.
   - using Judge Reveiw plugin for creating sample reviews.

2. **Adding Schema Markup:**
   - Go to shopify admin and EDit Code.
   - Locate "main-product.liquid" file to add the schema markup code.
   - Add schema markup using JSON-LD or Microdata. For example:
     ```json
     {
     "@context": "https://schema.org/",
      "@type": "Product",
      "name": "{{product.title}}",
      "image": "{{ shop. url }}/cdn/shop/{{ product.featured_image }}",
      "description": "{{page_description}}",
      "brand": {
        "@type": "Brand",
        "name": "{{product.vendor}}"
      },
      "sku": {{ product.selected_or_first_available_variant.sku | json }},
      "gtin13": {{ product.variants.first.barcode | json }},
      "offers": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "url": "{{ canonical_url }}",
        "priceValidUntil": "{{ 'now' | date: '%s' | plus: 31536000 | date: '%Y-%m-%d' | replace:'+','%20' }}",
        "priceCurrency": "{{shop.currency}}",
        "price": "{{product.price | money_without_currency}}",
        "availability": "https://schema.org/{% if product.selected_or_first_available_variant %}InStock{% else %}OutOfStock{% endif %}",
        "itemCondition": "https://schema.org/NewCondition"
      },
      "aggregateRating": {
        "@type": "AggregateRating",
        "ratingValue": "{{product.metafields.reviews.rating.value}}",
        "ratingCount": "{{product.metafields.reviews.rating_count}}"
      }
